										At AWS, I produced documentation across multiple channels such as developer guides, API and CloudFormation references, and UI text. The following are links to some samples of my work in both PDF (linked as [PDF]) and website (linked as [Web]) form taken directly from the public AWS docs websites for Amazon ECS and AWS Cloud Map. Note that the web versions may differ from the PDFs because the PDFs are a point-in-time snapshot of the docs.</p>
										<div class="row">
											<ul>
												
													<li><strong>Example CFN templates for Amazon ECS:</strong> Created and tested templates for various ECS resource types. Templates can be used by customers to get a sense of how they can use Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to create ECS task definitions, services, clusters etc. Sought SME feedback and leveraged generative AI wherever it made sense. Amazon Q CLI was my tool of choice for generative AI. <a href="images/ecs-cfn-dg.pdf">[PDF]</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-with-cloudformation.html">[Web]</a></li>
										 <li><strong>Refactored AWS Cloud Map documentation to be more scenario-based:</strong> Followed the maxim of 'one scenario per page' on most pages in the guide. This specific example refers to the Cloud Map services documentation and includes conceptual topics (what is a service, what are the supported health check and DNS configurations) and CRUD procedures. <a href="images/cloud-map-services.pdf">[PDF]</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/working-with-services.html">[Web]</a></li> 
										<li><strong>Cross-service integration chapter including multiple content type:</strong> This example includes a table for various storage options for ECS tasks, and the documentation for EBS volumes on ECS that includes example configurations, conceptual considerations, and troubleshooting information. <a href="images/ecs-storage-and-ebs.pdf">[PDF]</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_data_volumes.html">[Web]</a></li>
												<li><strong>Open-source AWS CLI tutorials:</strong> I was part of a group of five writers who contributed to this open-source project that provides customers CLI-based getting started tutorials and scripts. Customers can use the instructions we did for generating their own tutorials. Before repo creation, I helped refine the prompts and tutorials through testing. I also incorporated/encouraged incorporation of some of the tutorials in our developer guides during this first phase of the project. The principal writer leading the project had created a python script for converting markdown to XML for this first phase of the project. I updated that script to ensure it handled special characters in XML code blocks properly during conversion from Markdown. As part of repo creation during the second phase, I tested, updated, and then committed tutorials and scripts. The repo provides an experience for customers that helps them get started with the CLI and provides an alternative for those who may not be able to use a console. <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-developer-tutorials">[Web]</a></li>
												</li>
												<li>
													<strong>API reference data type documentation for ECS ContainerRestartPolicy:</strong> API Data types are objects that customers can pass into API calls. I wrote descriptions for the ContainerRestartPolicy object and its parameters. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerRestartPolicy.html">[Web]</a>
												</li>
												<li>
													<strong>API reference action documentation for Cloud Map UpdateServiceAttributes: </strong>Actions are operations that customers can perform using AWS APIs. I wrote descriptions for the action and the parameters. I also created the examples for the API call. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_UpdateServiceAttributes.html">[Web]</a>
												</li>
												<li>
													<strong>CLI examples for ECS update-service:</strong> AWS offers several different ways of interacting with APIs. The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is one such method of calling APIs. The descriptions for parameters are the same as the API reference and put together by multiple writers, including myself. The examples were created by multiple writers, including myself. I created the examples for using EBS volumes with ECS and to stop using EBS volumes with ECS. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/update-service.html#examples">[Web]</a>
												</li>
												<li><strong>UI text for ECS/EBS integration on the ECS console:</strong> Collaborated with frontend engineers and a UX designer on the text for each field and the 'help panel' displayed when clicking the 'Info' button. For this integration, I had to ensure that the wording was consistent with the EBS console. <a href="images/ebs-ui.pdf">[PDF]</a></li>
												<li><strong>UI text for ECS restart policy on the ECS console:</strong> Collaborated with frontend engineers on the text for each field and the 'help panel' displayed when clicking the 'Info' button. <a href="images/restart-policy-ui.pdf">[PDF]</a></li>
