# About me

I'm Anupras, a technical writer with almost 3 years experience at [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com). I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and journalism from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://aws.amazon.com). I was born in India, raised in the United Arab Emirates, and have studied and worked in the United States.

I'm currently based in Austin, Texas and open to relocation if necessary. I'm excited by the prospect of exploring new cities and countries through work. In fact, that's how I ended up in Austin, and it's been good.

Outside of work, I am:

- A football (soccer) and Formula 1 aficionado
- A trivia enthusiast
- A sporadic writer and a casual reader
- A fan of indie rock
- An appreciator of the variety of cultures, languages, and cuisines the world has to offer

## Why technical writing?

In 2020, a teaching assistant (TA) for a linguistics class that I was taking had mentioned working as a technical writer prior to academia. It was the first semester of a COVID-riddled sophomore year. I wasn't thinking about my career then, but somewhere in the back of my mind, I made note of technical writing as a potential future profession.

By late 2021, I was a junior who was actively looking for internships. I had already applied to a handful of tech internships when the memory of my old TA resurfaced. I took a moment to explore the profession more closely and realized it made perfect sense. Technical writing was the perfect convergence of my academic background. The idea of helping customers accomplish their goals through documentation and, in the process, getting to learn new technologies seemed fulfilling. With this realization, my internship search was more focused, and I eventually found an opportunity at AWS.

Years after deciding to pursue technical writing professionally, I'm happy to say that it's been as enjoyable as I thought it would be.

## Professional journey

My professional journey so far has been one of progression at AWS.

### Technical Writer II: July 2025 - January 2026

I got promoted to Technical Writer II ahead of Q3 2025. I was involved in writing documentation for Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and AWS Cloud Map. I contributed to projects such as an open-source AWS CLI tutorials repository, product documentation for shared AWS Cloud Map namespaces, and an Infrastructure as Code chapter for Amazon ECS customer. For more information about these projects, see the following links in the portfolio:

- [CLI tutorials](docs/broader-initiatives/open-source-tutorials)
- [Shared namespaces](docs/dev-guide/shared-namespaces)
- [Infrastructure as code](docs/broader-initiatives/infrastructure-as-code)

### Technical Writer I: July 2023 - June 2025

After a successful internship and graduation, I returned to AWS as a full-time writer. I started out working on documentation for Amazon ECS, resolving customer feedback tickets and refreshing tutorial steps for the first month or two. By the end of 2023, I was involved in a cross-service integration for Amazon ECS with Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). In May 2024, I took over ownership of documentation for AWS Cloud Map. In the following months, I was involved in projects such as scenario-based content refactoring, Amazon ECS restart policies, Cloud Map service-level attributes, and AWS CLI and SDK example expansion. For more information about these projects, see the following links in the portfolio:

- [ECS integration with EBS developer guide](docs/dev-guide/ecs-ebs-integration)
- [ECS integration with EBS UI](docs/ui-text/ecs-ebs-integration-ui)
- [ECS restart policies API](docs/api-docs/data-types)
- [ECS restart policies UI](docs/ui-text/ecs-restart-policy-ui)
- [Cloud Map service-level attributes](docs/api-docs/operations)
- [Scenario-based content refactoring](docs/broader-initiatives/scenario-based-content-refactoring)
- [CLI and SDK examples](docs/broader-initiatives/cli-sdk-examples)

### Technical Writer Intern: June 2022 - August 2022

I interned at AWS as a writer on the Amazon ECS team. My internship experience was somewhat unconventional in that I got to work on a variety of tasks instead of a single project. The tasks I worked on included the following

- [Updating an Amazon ECS Service Discovery tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-service-discovery.html)
- Creating a couple AWS CloudFormation infrastructure as code templates
- Updating an existing CLI example
- Fixing syntax errors in a couple [code snippets in TypeScript and JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/tutorial-ecs-web-server-cdk.html#ecs-web-server-cdk-step-2).

I even got the brief experience of documenting a new feature for Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). However, the launch was rolled back and not redone during or after my internship.

## Academic journey

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2023. I studied computer science and journalism. I was also an active member of the [Daily Cardinal](https://www.dailycardinal.com/page/about-us), UW-Madison's leading on-campus student newspaper. The following are some highlights from my time as a student at UW-Madison:

- I was [Opinion](https://www.dailycardinal.com/section/opinion) editor at the Daily Cardinal in 2020. I worked with a coeditor to review editorial submissions from a group of 5-10 contributors and ensure that we had editorials ready to publish every Thursday. Collaborated across time zones, with differences of up to 10 hours. Followed the Associated Press (AP) styleguide.
- I was a member of the editorial board at the Daily Cardinal from January 2020 to May 2023. I worked collaboratively with other members of the board to define the stance of the organization on issues relevant to the student body in the form of [editorials co-authored under the editorial board byline](https://www.dailycardinal.com/search?a=1&s=&ti=&ts_month=01&ts_day=0&ts_year=2020&te_month=05&te_day=0&te_year=2023&au=The+Daily+Cardinal+Editorial+Board&tg=&ty=article&o=date).
- I was a staff writer at the Daily Cardinal from September 2019 to December 2019, and a senior staff writer from January 2021 to May 2023. Wrote [80 articles](https://www.dailycardinal.com/staff/anupras-mohapatra) ranging from editorials to food and music reviews to poetry and soccer recaps. Not all of it was great writing, but I learned a lot.
- I received a [Online: Best Editorial or Commentary - Gold](https://milwaukeepressclub.org/2022-excellence-in-journalism-awardees/#collegiate) award from the Milwaukee Press Club for a 2022 editorial I wrote. The oldest continously operating press club in North America, the Milwaukee Press Club recognizes Wisconsin-based college students annually for excellence in student journalism.
- I received the [Sigrid Schultz scholarship](https://wisc.academicworks.com/opportunities/86867) in March 2023 and [Catherine E Klein memorial fund scholarship](https://wisc.academicworks.com/opportunities/86661) in March 2022 from the UW-Madison School of Journalism and Mass Communications.
- I was on the Dean's list in these semesters: Fall 2019, Spring 2020, Fall 2020, Fall 2021, Fall 2022, Spring 2023
- I graduated with a GPA of 3.78/4
