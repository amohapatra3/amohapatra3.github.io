# Storytelling

I spent about four years at the Daily Cardinal — a student organization that is UW-Madison's leading on-campus student newspaper — and wrote 80 articles. My experience at the Cardinal provides me some background in telling stories through op-eds and reviews. The following is a small sampling of me telling a variety of stories:

- [Finding solace in Sundrop as a teetotaler at UW-Madison](https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2022/10/finding-solace-in-sundrop-as-a-teetotaler-at-uw-madison): This article reflects on the drinking culture of Wisconsin and my experience as someone who doesn't really drink.
- [STEM Major Spotlight: Computer Science](https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2023/03/stem-major-spotlight-computer-science): This article walks the reader through the computer science major, in some ways selling the discipline to the reader.
- [A review of Naf Naf Grill on State](https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2022/11/a-review-of-naf-naf-grill-on-state): This article provides a brief explainer on what Shawarma is, why it matters to me, and what the business does well.
- [Tackling the animal cracker conundrum](https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2022/04/tackling-the-animal-cracker-conundrum): A story about a recent Cardinal tradition and my experience with it.
