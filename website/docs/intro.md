# Introduction to the portfolio

This portfolio is a collection of writing samples from my time at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the Daily Cardinal. At the Daily Cardinal, I wrote introspective op-eds and reviews, often sharing with readers why something mattered. At AWS, I wrote developer documentation for Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and AWS Cloud Map.

Amazon ECS is a container orchestration service that allows customers to run application code and its dependencies on cloud-based virtual servers (Amazon EC2 instances). Customers can focus on code and configurations, while ECS handles infrastructure on their behalf. For more information about Amazon ECS, see [What is Amazon ECS?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html)

AWS Cloud Map is a service that allows customers to register and track backend AWS resources using API calls and DNS queries. For more information about AWS Cloud Map, see [What is AWS Cloud Map?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/what-is-cloud-map.html)

My portfolio consists of five sections for the different types of content I have delivered:

- Developer documentation
- API reference
- Developer experience and information architecture
- Content design
- Storytelling

To learn more about me, see [About me](/about).

## Developer documentation

Developer documentation samples focus on developer guide updates that I made in response to net new product functionality, internal or external feedback, and updates to existing functionality. To view examples of this type of documentation, see **[Developer documentation](category/developer-documentation)**.

## API reference

The API reference samples include parameter descriptions and examples that I created for Amazon ECS and AWS Cloud Map APIs. To view examples of this type of documentation, see **[API reference](category/api-documentation)**.

## Developer experience and information architecture

Besides working on regular feature documentation, I worked on projects in domains such as developer experience and information architecture. These projects often involved collaboration with other stakeholders. To learn more about these projects, see **[Developer experience and information architecture](category/developer-experience-and-information-architecture)**.

## Content design

For customers that don't want to call APIs programmatically, AWS provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) called the AWS Management Console. Updates to the APIs would often result in updates to this console such as new forms and fields. I contributed to microcopy on the console for new or updated Amazon ECS and AWS Cloud Map forms and fields. I also contributed to error messages that are returned when API calls fail. To view examples of this type of documentation, see **[Content design](category/content-design)**.

## Storytelling

Storytelling samples are a small sampling of the articles I wrote for the Daily Cardinal, UW-Madison's leading student newspaper. To view samples, see **[Storytelling](storytelling)**.
