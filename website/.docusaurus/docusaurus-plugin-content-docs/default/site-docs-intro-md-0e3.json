  "description": "This portfolio is a collection of writing samples from my time at Amazon Web Services (AWS) working on docs for Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and AWS Cloud Map. Amazon ECS is a container orchestration service that allows customers to run application code and its dependencies on cloud-based virtual servers (Amazon EC2 instances). Customers can focus on code and configurations, while ECS handles infrastructure on their behalf. AWS Cloud Map is a service that allows customers to register and track backend AWS resources using API calls and DNS queries.",
