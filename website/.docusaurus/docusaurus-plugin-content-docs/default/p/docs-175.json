The API, in most cases, returns a JSON response. The request and response JSON bodies can contain complex objects comprised of multiple parameters. These complex structures are called data types. When documenting APIs at AWS, I was responsible for the descriptions of data types and their constituent parameters. The following example in my portfolio showcases how I handled descriptions for an Amazon ECS data type called RestartPolicy.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"api-docs/operations":{"id":"api-docs/operations","title":"API operation documentation for AWS Cloud Map","description":"An Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer can perform a variety of operations using APIs. For example, they can create an AWS resource such as an S3 bucket, update the resource, retrieve information about the resource, and delete the resource (CRUD operations). These operations are also referred to as actions. When documenting APIs at AWS, I was responsible for the descriptions of actions and their associated request and response parameters. I also created request and response examples for the actions.

In December 2024, I was trying to determine areas in Amazon ECS and AWS Cloud Map documentation that could be improved on. With the holidays not far, I had the time to work on a self-directed project like this. I looked at the CLI and SDK references for both services and found something to work on.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"broader-initiatives/infrastructure-as-code":{"id":"broader-initiatives/infrastructure-as-code","title":"Expanding Infrastructure as Code content for Amazon ECS","description":"Infrastrtucture as Code (IaC) is a construct that allows customers to manage entire cloud infrastructures using templates.

Amazon ECS is a container orchestration service that allows customers to run application code and its dependencies on cloud-based virtual servers (Amazon EC2 instances). Customers can focus on code and configurations, while ECS handles infrastructure on their behalf. AWS Cloud Map is a service that allows customers to register and track backend AWS resources using API calls and DNS queries.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ui-text/ecs-ebs-integration-ui":{"id":"ui-text/ecs-ebs-integration-ui","title":"UI updates for Amazon ECS integration with Amazon EBS","description":"Amazon Web Services (AWS) consists of 200+ products/services, and there are many integrations between services.
