These operations are also referred to as actions. When documenting APIs at AWS, I was responsible for the descriptions of actions and their associated request and response parameters.

At the Daily Cardinal, I wrote introspective op-eds and reviews, often sharing with readers why something mattered. At AWS, I wrote developer documentation for Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and AWS Cloud Map. Amazon ECS is a container orchestration service that allows customers to run application code and its dependencies on cloud-based virtual servers (Amazon EC2 instances). Customers can focus on code and configurations, while ECS handles infrastructure on their behalf. AWS Cloud Map is a service that allows customers to register and track backend AWS resources using API calls and DNS queries.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"storytelling":{"id":"storytelling","title":"Storytelling","description":"I spent about four years at the Daily Cardinal — a student organization that is UW-Madison's leading on-campus student newspaper — and wrote 80 articles.

In October 2025, Amazon ECS added support for running the FireLens container as a non-root user to improve application security.
