  "description": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) consists of 200+ products/services, and there are many integrations between services. I worked on documentation for a cross-service integration between AWS Cloud Map and AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) that allows customers to create shared Cloud Map namespaces. I also worked on documentation for shared namespaces being supported for Amazon ECS Service Connect — a feature of Amazon ECS that provides management of communication between Amazon ECS services.",
