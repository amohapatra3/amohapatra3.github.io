  "description": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers several ways for customers to use APIs such as direct API calls, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) commands, and AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) requests in several programming languages. In December 2024, I was trying to determine areas in Amazon ECS and AWS Cloud Map documentation that could be improved on.
