										 <p> My documentation creation process for new product functionality involved monitoring the product roadmap on Asana, reading design docs, testing the functionality, and getting reviews by engineering and product. Feature work often involved walking engineers through shared processes and making prioritization decisions between concurrent projects. In addition to feature documentation, I worked on customer feedback mostly in the form of feedback tickets that came directly from customers or indirectly via colleagues that engaged with customers directly (SAs, support engineers, etc). I also used metrics based on page views and thumbs up/down feedback. I was an engaged member of the documentation org who contributed to organizational goals such as scenario-based content refactoring and an open-source tutorial project for accessibility.</p> The following are links to some samples of my work:</p>
										<div class="row">
											<ul>
												
													<li><a href="images/ecs-cfn-dg.pdf"><span class="label">Using AWS CloudFormation to create Amazon ECS resources (a mix of conceptual, task, and reference topics)</span></a>: Created and tested templates. Sought SME feedback and leveraged generative AI wherever necessary.</li>
										 <li><a href="images/cloud-map-services.pdf">Refactored AWS Cloud Map documentation to be more scenario-based</a>: Tried to follow the maxim of 'one scenario per page' on most pages in the guide. This specific example refers to the Cloud Map services documentation.</li> 
										<li><a href="images/ecs-storage-and-ebs.pdf">Cross-service integration chapter including multiple content types</a>. This example includes a table for various storage options for ECS tasks, and the documentation for EBS volumes on ECS.</li>
												</li>
												<li><a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-developer-tutorials">Open-source project I contributed to that provides customers CLI-based getting started tutorials and instructions for generating further tutorials.</a>: Before repo creation, I helped refine the prompts and tutorials through testing. I also incorporated/encouraged incorporation of some of the tutorials in our developer guides during the first phase of the project. As part of repo creation during the second phase, I tested, updated, and then committed tutorials and scripts. The repo provides a CLI experience for customers that may not be able to use a console.</li>
