											<h1>Hi, I’m Anupras</h1><br />
										</header>
										<p> In 2023, I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Journalism. After graduating, I worked as a technical writer for Amazon Web Services, returning full-time after a successful internship in 2022 and getting promoted in 2025.</p> <p>At AWS, my documentation creation process for new product functionality involved monitoring the product roadmap on Asana, reading design docs, testing product functionality, and getting reviews by engineering and product. Feature work often involved walking engineers through shared processes and making prioritization decisions between concurrent projects. In addition to feature documentation, I worked on feedback tickets that either came directly from customers or indirectly from colleagues that engaged with customers (SAs, support engineers, etc). I also used metrics based on page views and thumbs up/down feedback for updates. I was recognized multiple times as a "collaboration champion" in the docs organization who contributed to goals such as scenario-based content refactoring and an open-source tutorial project for accessibility.</p> 	
										<p>In college, I spent almost all 4 years working various roles for the <a href="https://www.dailycardinal.com/">Daily Cardinal </a>, which is the leading student newspaper at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 2023, I received an award from the Milwaukee Press Club — one of the oldest press clubs in the U.S. — for an editorial I wrote for the Cardinal. My journalism background has helped me better adhere to style guides and keep documentation simple.</p>
										<p>As a computer science major, I got to work on assignments in Java, JavaScript, and Python. This technical background has helped me create and update example snippets, review code for error messages and UI text, test technical features, and write documentation in a docs-as-code environment.</p>
